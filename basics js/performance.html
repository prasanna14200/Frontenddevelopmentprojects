    Reduce DOM Access
    Accessing the HTML DOM is very slow, compared to other JavaScript statements.
    
    If you expect to access a DOM element several times, access it once, and use it as a local variable:

    Avoid Unnecessary Variables

    Delay JavaScript Loading

    Accidentally Using the Assignment Operator

    You must use a "backslash" if you must break a statement in a string:
    What is JSON?
    JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
    JSON is a lightweight data interchange format
    JSON is language independent *
    JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand

    Then, use the JavaScript built-in function JSON.parse() to convert the string into a JavaScript object:

    const obj = JSON.parse(text);

<script>
let text = '{ "employees" : [' +
'{ "firstName":"John" , "lastName":"Doe" },' +
'{ "firstName":"Anna" , "lastName":"Smith" },' +
'{ "firstName":"Peter" , "lastName":"Jones" } ]}';


class Car {
  constructor(name, year) {
    this.name = name;
    this.year = year;
  }
}








</script>
